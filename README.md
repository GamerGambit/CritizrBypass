# CritzrBypass
Userscript to bypass Critizr/Goodays "AI"

This userscript was designed for use with Tampermonkey on Chrome and designed to respond to new messages and dissatisfaction alerts according to how my management team would.

For new dissatisfaction alerts it will reply with a template and put the customer on hold so an actual team member can review it.
For dissatisfaction alerts with no remark and new messages that need a reply it will automatically mark them as done with no reply and no further action required by a team member.

## Why?
Critizr/Goodays decided it would be a good idea to launch "AI" responses which will respond to your feedback if you dont without an hour and charge you for it. Even if the feedback is positive or is submitted at 3am.
This does not work in our industry where our peak period has upwards of 50-100 customers every hour and our management team already responds to feedback every 24-48 hours.
